  abstract = {Graph pattern matching is fundamental to social network analysis. Traditional techniques are subgraph isomorphism and graph simulation. However, these notions often impose too strong a topological constraint on graphs to find meaningful matches. Worse still, graphs in the real world are typically large, with millions of nodes and billions of edges. It is often prohibitively expensive to compute matches in such graphs. With these comes the need for revising the notions of graph pattern matching and for developing techniques of querying large graphs, to effectively and efficiently identify social communities or groups.This paper aims to provide an overview of recent advances in the study of graph pattern matching in social networks. (1) We present several revisions of the traditional notions of graph pattern matching to find sensible matches in social networks. (2) We provide boundedness analyses of incremental graph pattern matching, in response to frequent updates to social networks. (3) To cope with large real-life graphs, we propose a framework of query preserving graph compression, which retains only information necessary for answering a certain class of queries of users' choice. (4) We also address pattern matching in distributed graphs, and in particular, advocate the use of partial evaluation techniques. Finally, we identify directions for future research.},
